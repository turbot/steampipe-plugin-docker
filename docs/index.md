# Docker + Steampipe

[Docker](https://docker.com) provides OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

Query commands from a Dockerfile:

```sql
select
  cmd,
  args
from
  dockerfile_cmd
where
  path = '/my/Dockerfile';
```

```

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/docker/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Docker plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install docker
```

### Credentials

No credentials are required.

### Configuration

Installing the latest docker plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/docker.spc`) with a single connection named `docker`:

```hcl
connection "docker" {
  plugin = "docker"

  # Paths is a list of locations to search for Dockerfiles
  # All paths are resolved relative to the current working directory (CWD)
  # Wildcard based searches are supported, including recursive searches

  # For example:
  #  - "*.dockerfile" matches all Dockerfiles in the CWD
  #  - "**/*.dockerfile" matches all Dockerfiles in the CWD and all sub-directories
  #  - "../*.dockerfile" matches all Dockerfiles in the CWD's parent directory
  #  - "Dockerfile.*" matches all Dockerfiles starting with "Dockerfile" in the CWD
  #  - "/path/to/dir/*.dockerfile" matches all Dockerfiles in a specific directory
  #  - "/path/to/dir/Dockerfile" matches a specific file

  # If paths includes "*", all files (including non-Dockerfiles) in
  # the CWD will be matched, which may cause errors if incompatible file types exist

  # Defaults to CWD
  paths = [ "Dockerfile", "*.dockerfile" ]

  # Optional docker engine configuration.
  # host        = "tcp://192.168.59.103:2376"
  # cert_path   = "/path/to/my-cert"
  # api_version = "1.41"
  # tls_verify  = true
}
```

- `paths` - A list of directory paths to search for Dockerfiles. Paths are resolved relative to the current working directory. Paths may [include wildcards](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Match) and also supports `**` for recursive matching. Defaults to the current working directory.
- `host` - Location of the docker engine endpoint. Defaults to `DOCKER_HOST` env var.
- `api_version` - API version to use. Defaults to `DOCKER_API_VERSION` env var.
- `cert_path` - Path to a custom TLS certificate. Defaults to `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` env var.
- `tls_verify` - Flag to control TLS verification. Defaults to `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY` env var.
